This is an implementation of 1D Pac-Man using Javascript to run the game and HTML to render it on a browser. It allows the user to control pacman, eat pellets and track their score.

## How to Run:

1. Open "pacman.html"
2. Game begins upon opening in browser
3. Move Pacman with Left and Right arrow keys

## Score System:

Eating a pellet increases the score by 1. When all pellets are eaten, you will proceed to the next level. The next level has 3 more spaces than the previous. The score continues to build accross each level.

## Ghost Behaviour:

In the current implementation, the ghost moves randmoly left and right. The ghost cannot kill pacman as that was an optional feature of this assignment.
